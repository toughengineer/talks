# C++ Russia 2019 Piter

## Insights into the C++ standard library

A couple of things about the C++ standard library implementation you might want to know.

We'll discuss:

how strengthened O(n log n) worst case complexity is guaranteed for std::sort;
* when to use std::sort, std::stable_sort, std::partial_sort, std::nth_element;
* when to use std::unordered_set/map and when std::set/map;
* when to use std::vector and when std::list;
* how small string optimization (SSO) works.

And other nuances of the C++ standard library implementation.
