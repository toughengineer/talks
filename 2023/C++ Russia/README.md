# C++ Russia 2023

## `flat_map`<br>Who needs them? They're just like `std::map`. We all have them.

`flat_map` may seem like an unfamiliar animal, but you probably used it many times, maybe not realizing it: in essence `flat_map` is just a sorted sequence.

In this talk we will

* compare `flat_map` to existing standard associative containers,
* overview popular existing implementations of `flat_map`,
* look at what is proposed to be included in the C++ standard library,
* and try to draw some conclusions of what kind of `flat_map` do we really want to have in C++.

In the end you should get a good understanding of what a `flat_map` _is_, and in what situations you should use it.
