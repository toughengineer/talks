# C++ Siberia 2020

## `std::initializer_list` &mdash; ~~epic~~ fail of design

It looks relatively simple on the surface:
`std::initializer_list` is a lightweight wrapper around an array of elements built into the C++ language.
But the deeper you dig, the more you think that something is fishy here...

Universal initialization, `auto`, constructors, initialization of aggregate types with parentheses`()`...  
We will try to sort out the details of all of that and figure out how to live with it.
