## JSON in C++: designing a type for working with JSON values

We'll dive into designing a C++ type for working with JSON values. We will:
* remind ourselves some basic ideas and nuances of type design in C++;
* carefully look back at the standard containers and `std::variant`;
* try to make the interface easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly;
* and add support for C++ allocators.

Along the way, we'll hit a few bumps on the standard library implementations and a compiler.

After the talk, among other things, you will have a good idea of how to cook `std::variant`.
