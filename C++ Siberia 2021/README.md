## Making state machines with templates and coroutines

Finite state machine, or simply *state machine* is a simple and very expressive way of describing logic.  
Very often logic that needs to be coded is either already presented in state machine form, or *asks* to be coded in that form.

There are no standard means to represent state machines in C++, so (in addition to many existing ways) we will discuss how to implement it in modern C++ in two more ways:
* with help of template magic,
* and using coroutines.

Along the way we'll examine several techniques that may be helpful in different situations not connected to state machines.
