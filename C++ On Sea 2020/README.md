# C++ On Sea 2020

## Serialization in C++ has never been easier!<br/>But wait, there's more...

Proposal [P1717](https://wg21.link/P1717) offers superpowers unparalleled to what we had before, even comparing to the most elaborate template metaprogramming techniques.

We'll have a glimpse of that and learn how to harness that power by example implementation of serialization.

We'll see what upcoming reflection has to offer, and how metaprogramming in C++ will dramatically change in the future.
