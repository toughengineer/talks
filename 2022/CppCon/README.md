# CppCon 2022

## Understanding C++ coroutines by example,<br>part 2: generators

Coroutines are a powerful tool added to C++20. There are no out-of-the-box facilities in the standard library that are user friendly and immediately usable, although there are plenty of libraries out there already providing such primitives.

Also there are now best practices regarding usage of coroutines in C++ that emerged while people were learning them, and that programmers should know about.

This time we will concentrate on the _generators_ part of the coroutines.\
We'll get up to speed with how coroutines work under the hood, and then learn about the `co_yield` keyword, and how simple generators and asynchronous generators conceptually work.
